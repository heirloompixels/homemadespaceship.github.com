The evolution of an image is minutely tied to its creation.  Really a piece of art is never done and it's never started.  It's never finished, the artist just stoped working on it.  The finaly product is a rather arbitrary position in it's reality.  Really, it could have been any of a million different possibilities but the one you see is the one you get. 

Oh that is quite a bit of babble the type of stuff artist statements are birthed with.  I'm here to let you in on a little secret about how to make art.  It's just chance.  Its knowing when to stop and when to start again and it's the guts to do it.  Also helps to be an interesting person. 

Variations are the exploration of this objectification of the abstract.  Like that one?  So what we are doing here is reusing the same imagery over and over and over again.  Two parrallel paths - the OG - in this case an oil painting and then the prints.  The prints are made with pure carbon ink on watercolor paper with my printer - 100% eternally archival and amazingly beutufil too.  Then the prints are worked on.  They are a point of departure from the original.  A whisper of what it could have been had the brush strokes played a different hand. 

To me it's liberation.  I can do each one and not fret over what about this idea.  I just do that idea.  And it's interesting too.  Slight variations of repetion.  Love that shit.
