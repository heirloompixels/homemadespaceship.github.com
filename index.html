  		  Right now we are building our home.  It is a teardrop style trailer and will be our dwelling for at least the next year. 
  		  It's a tiny house our inspiration was from the tinyhouseblog.com.  Once completed we will engage in some nomadic wanderings 
  		  around the western portion of the United States.  We'll make a lot of neat stuff (read adjacent paragraph) and we'll visit 
  		  with a lot of people - but for now we just have to build the hom.  You can follow the story here.

  		  At the same time we are still creating some neat stuff - have a look!  We
  		  make a living off of said neat stuff which convieniently is very reasonably priced. 
  		  Maybe you'd like to have a look currently available need stuff for purchase at etsy.
