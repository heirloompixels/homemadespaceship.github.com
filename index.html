<p>Soon, very soon more of this site will be intact, in fact, large portions of it are just now sprouting.  A whole population of photographs, art projects, maps  and discussions of things things we learn will burst out of the digital underground like mushrooms on the forest floor.  And updates, oh there will be updates, and snacks too, so please visit again soon, very soon.</p>

<p>Until then, the old favorites are still alive and well:</p>
