        <h3>Now for sale.</h3>
        <p>
          The fort is for sale.  12000 USD is the price which is not bad considering the materials alone are 3500 USD.  Its proven itself very well to us and with a years worth of extremem testing and design modifications im confident that itll last many many years, with of coarse, the proper maintanece.  its not totally a park and forget camper, itll need some love and care over the years as it is wood and wood is always alive.  i think that the largest issues have been resolved, though, and it is ready for a new home.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are no longer nomads, we own a small house now and had planned on jsing the fort as a guest bedroom.  but it looks lonely there and we need the space for our next project.  the fort had been a home for us for a year and its almost impossible to say goodbye to it, but its time, oh time, to do so.
          </p>
        <p>
          of coarse the fort is a perfect camper.  its spacios , easy to tow, comfortable to live in, and stylish.  its an awesome bedroom or guest building, i know of no one whom is not thrilled to settle down in it.  it is also a unique piece of art which catches everyones attention, itd be perfect as a promotional tour thype of a vehicle just simply to draw people in.  im especially interersted in finding someone who has a particularily interesting use in mind for the fort, send your ideas along.

    <h1>Act iii:  technology</h1>
      <p>Nomadism is radical self reliance, you have to be able to take care of yourself first and foremost and this requires a differnt set of skills then hou learn in the normal world.  strange skills, skills forgotten, skills often better than their modern counterparts.  now we have machines to replace skills, our tools are more complex so that their operators have to have less skills in using them,  in the past it was the oposite, you have simpler tools, often tools that you can build on your own, but you must have more skill in using them,  thankfully this skill is kind of universal.  it is simply the ability to use your hands, to be sensitive enough with your touch to accomplish a heavy handed task.  
      </p>
      <p>i dont think this technology is completely lost, it exists the world over in one form or another,  finding takes time as does developing your skill, but the reward is a self relaiance and ability to handle most tasks, problem soilve like sherlock holmes and invent like a mad scientist.  this is what wwe have learned or are working on
