2001 A Space Odyssey, opening scene.  Need I say more.  Humans are wired to love tools.  They kinda make us human.  

Tools are also extremely beutuful.  Once upon a time the makers of tools went to great lenghts to make their tools beutufl.  Some makers still do - there is a large resurgence of great tools of quality not available for fifty years on the market today.  

It's time to celebrate those tools, in their elegant functionality.  So I give you the tool fashion show. 

Now go support your local tool maker.
